## Draft 1
QR codes have become an integral part of our digital lives from streamlining payment, sharing information, and being instrumental in many nation's covid-19 response. They're now a common sight that no one thinks twice about. unrecognized for the elegant solution it has become into for many of our inconveniences

so this video will be a quick dive into what makes them tick. Shedding some light into how QR codes work

A QR code, or a quick response code is essentially 2d array of black and white squares. they are arranged in predetermined patterns to allow scanner such as your phone camera to read a message.

these patterns range in functions such allowing quick indentificatinos of the qr codes position and rotation.
noting which version of the qr code is being used, relaying it's error correction level and what type of masks is used.
a mask is basically a pattern to invert some parts of the code to reduce large patches of teh same color. these can confuse the scanner. (tangent slide up to reveal new screen)

and finally of course the actual message itself

(encoding; screen moves right side to encode)
The actual message begins with the type of encoding. like kanji, alpha numeric or most commonly ascii. an encoding is simply an agreen upon method of arranging  the squares to convey a message.

the most commonly used ascii encoding simply divides the english alphabet into different numbers and uses pattern of 8 squares to convey this number. (plug http request to subscribe to my channel)
these 8 squares are then chained together snaking throught the code to finally form the message

all of this to quickly and reliably relay information, easing our daily digital lives. And thats how the QR code works
